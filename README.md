# [![MEAN Logo](http://mean.io/system/assets/img/logos/meanlogo.png)](http://mean.io/) MEAN Stack

MEAN is a framework for an easy starting point with [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing MEAN based web apps with useful modules like Mongoose and Passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.
